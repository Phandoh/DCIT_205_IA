        <h1>Programming I</h1>
        <p>
          This course is expected to give students the understanding of
          object-oriented methodology, the approach to modular and reusable
          software systems. Object orientation will be discussed from ground up,
          pointing out and explaining key concepts of object orientation, its
          justification and how it is applied in Software Engineering. Students
          will be exposed to at least four language implementation to the
          covered principles and concepts- Java, C#, Python and PHP. Topics
          include: Classes and Objects, Object Design and Programming â€“
          Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Composition,
          Aggregation, Method overloading, Interfaces, Exception Handling,
          Collections, etc. This course will ensure that students have adequate
          practical exposure.
        </p>
        <h1>Mobile Application Development</h1>
        <p>
          This course studies the design and implementation of mobile
          applications for popular platforms including Blackberry, Android and
          Apple devices. The course will provide an overview of the various
          mobile platforms but will focus on developing applications for iPhone,
          iPod Touch and iPad. Programming topics covered will include an
          introduction to Objective-C, the XCode IDE and will focus on
          designing, implementing and running applications using the simulator
          for the various Apple devices. Students will leverage their 12 | Page
          object oriented programming skills for such things classes, objects,
          inheritance, exception handling, and graphical user interface design.
        </p>
        <h1>Digital and Logic Systems Design</h1>
        <p>
          This course will provide an overview of principles and Techniques of
          modern digital systems. This course exposes individuals to a wide
          array of classic as well as state of the art digital electronics
          technology. Topics Include: Introduction to numbers systems and codes,
          logics circuits, combinational and sequential logic, storage elements,
          digital arithmetic, integrated circuit logic families. An Overview of
          Technologies and Application of wide array of digital components used
          within state of the art IT Systems. An understanding of the
          applications of such digital devices embedded within
          telecommunications systems, storage systems, computing systems,
          multimedia systems, and computer networks.
        </p>
        <h1>Data Structures and Algorithms I</h1>
        <p>
          This course focuses on the fundamentals of computer algorithms,
          emphasizing methods useful in practice. Using the big-O notation,
          algorithms are classified by their efficiency. We look into basic
          algorithm strategies and approaches to problem solving. Some of these
          approaches include the divide and conquer method, dynamic programming,
          and greedy programming paradigms. Sorting and searching algorithms are
          discussed in detail as they form part of a solution to a large number
          of problems solved using computers. The course also provides an
          introduction to the graph theory and graph algorithms as they are also
          used in many computer-based applications today.
