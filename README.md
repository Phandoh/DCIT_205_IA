With this project I have learnt a lot of concepts in both HTML and CSS.
For HTML, I learnt how to structure my page into parts using divs as well as semantic HTML.
I also learnt new tags such as span, ul, li etc.

For CSS, I learnt how to use the box sizing model to style divs, how to insert background images and colors with linear gradients, how to use CSS specificity for styling, CSS positioning etc.

Finally, I believe i have also learnt how to familiarize myslef with newer technologies faster and independently.
