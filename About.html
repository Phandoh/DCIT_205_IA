        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Computer science is the foundation of the information technology era
          that we are living in. Therefore, if society is to make rapid economic
          advancements and fully benefit from information technology, computer
          science education is essential. The study and creation of applications
          that enable us to use computers on a daily basis, the software systems
          that underpin these applications, and the techniques and procedures
          employed to create applications and systems that function dependably,
          accurately, and morally are all included in computer science. The
          ability to program computers is at the core of computer science, and
          companies hiring computer scientists look for skilled programmers who
          understand current methods and tools and can apply good engineering
          principles to the creation, building, and upkeep of computer programs.
          Our graduates are prepared for the computing industry by the variety
          of courses offered in the department and the skills they acquire.
          These courses enable students to work in a project team, research and
          development team, or other setting where they can contribute
          specialized skills. Additionally, by exposing students to current
          computer science research topics and both established and emerging
          technologies and methodologies, the course offers a platform for
          additional study or research. The Department offers two undergraduate
          degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
          Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor
          of Science in Information Technology.
